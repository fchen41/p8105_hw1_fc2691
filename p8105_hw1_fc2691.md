## Problem 1

### Create a Data Frame

*This problem is intended to emphasize variable types and introduce
coercion; some awareness of how R treats numeric, character, and factor
variables is necessary for working with these data types in practice.*

``` r
#Create a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
random_list <- rnorm(10, 0, 1)  

# Make elements of the sample are greater than 0
positive_elements <- random_list > 0  

#Create data frame containing variables
df <- data.frame(
  random = random_list,
  pov = positive_elements,
  char = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("a","b","c","a","b","c","a","b","c","a"))
)
df
```

    ##        random   pov char factor_vec
    ## 1  -1.9875899 FALSE    a          a
    ## 2   1.0416575  TRUE    b          b
    ## 3   0.3875849  TRUE    c          c
    ## 4   2.4705940  TRUE    d          a
    ## 5  -1.4039219 FALSE    e          b
    ## 6  -0.2246414 FALSE    f          c
    ## 7  -0.6625588 FALSE    g          a
    ## 8   0.3202803  TRUE    h          b
    ## 9   1.3474352  TRUE    i          c
    ## 10 -0.9379658 FALSE    j          a

``` r
mean(df$random)
```

    ## [1] 0.03508739

``` r
mean(df$pov)
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(df$char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df$char): argument is not numeric or logical: returning
    ## NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(df$factor_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df$factor_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

### Calculate Mean

***Requirement***: *Take the mean of a variable in a dataframe, pull the
variable out of the dataframe. Try loading the tidyverse and using the
pull function.*

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
df %>%
  pull(var = 1) %>% 
  mean()
```

    ## [1] 0.03508739

``` r
mean_pov = mean(pull(df, var = 2))
mean_pov
```

    ## [1] 0.5

-   **What is the mean of each variable in your dataframe? What works
    and what doesn’t?**  
    R could calculate the mean of numeric variables.  
    R would treat “TRUE” as 1 and “FALSE” as 0, and then calculate the
    mean of that list.  
    Mean doesn’t work for characters and factors.

-   **Convert variables from one type to another**  
    *Write a code chunk that applies the **as.numeric** function to the
    logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but
    not the output). What happens, and why? Does this help explain what
    happens when you try to take the mean?*

``` r
as.numeric(positive_elements)
is.numeric(positive_elements)
as.numeric(c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j")) 
as.numeric(factor(c("a","b","c","a","b","c","a","b","c","a")))
is.numeric(factor(c("a","b","c","a","b","c","a","b","c","a")))
is.numeric(as.numeric(factor(c("a","b","c","a","b","c","a","b","c","a"))))
```

Got “Warning” message when applied “as.numeric” function to character
variables. So character cannot be calculated as numeric or change to
numeric. However, as.numeric() could change factors, with its three
levels, to corresponded numbers and mean can then be calculated. Same it
could change the logic “TRUE” and “FALSE” to number 1 and 0. While logic
and factors themselves are still not numeric.
