## Problem 1 

### Create a Data Frame
  
*This problem is intended to emphasize variable types and introduce coercion; some awareness of how R treats numeric, character, and factor variables is necessary for working with these data types in practice.*  

```{r}
#Create a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
random_list <- rnorm(10, 0, 1)  

# Make elements of the sample are greater than 0
positive_elements <- random_list > 0  

#Create data frame containing variables
df <- data.frame(
  random = random_list,
  pov = positive_elements,
  char = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("a","b","c","a","b","c","a","b","c","a"))
)
df
mean(df$random)
mean(df$pov)
mean(df$char)
mean(df$factor_vec)
```
